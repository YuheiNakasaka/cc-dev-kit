# Proactively Use Skills and SubAgents

## When to Use Each

- **Skill**: Tasks requiring domain expertise → Read `SKILL.md` before starting and apply procedures/constraints directly. Don't just declare usage—actually follow through.
- **SubAgent**: Tasks where independent context is beneficial (refactoring, reviews, broad exploration), or when parallel execution is desired.

Note: Both can be used together. You may pass Skill knowledge to a SubAgent for execution.
Note: For small tasks without matching Skills/SubAgents, proceed with the normal flow.

## Be Explicit About Usage

State which Skill/SubAgent you're using and why in one line before proceeding.
